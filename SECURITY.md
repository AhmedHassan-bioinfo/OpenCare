## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously.  
If you discover a vulnerability or data protection concern, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**
   - Security issues must be handled responsibly and privately.

2. **Contact the maintainers directly:**
   - Email: [ahmednasser1378@gmail.com]

3. **Provide details**:
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Potential impact.
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

4. We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and provide a timeline for investigation and resolution.

## Data Privacy Considerations

- OpenCare is a **research and clinical decision support tool**.  
- Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) when running analyses on patient data.
- The maintainers do not collect, process, or store user genomic data; all analyses run locally or within the user’s environment.

## Disclosure Policy

- Once a vulnerability is confirmed and patched, we will:
  - Publish a new release with the fix.
  - Update the changelog and release notes.
  - Credit the reporter, if desired.
